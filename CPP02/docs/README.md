# CPP02

## About

**CPP02** is the third module of the 42 C++ curriculum and introduces important concepts related to **operator overloading, fixed-point arithmetic, and the Orthodox Canonical Form** in C++.

In this module, the goal is to understand how classes behave when copied, assigned, or destroyed, and how to properly implement the canonical functions that control object lifecycle.

## ex00 — My First Canonical Class

This exercise introduces the **Orthodox Canonical Form** in C++.

A Fixed class is created by implementing the four canonical functions:
- Default constructor
- Copy constructor
- Copy assignment operator
- Destructor

The class stores a fixed-point value internally in an `int fixedPointNumber`, with 8 fractional bits stored as a static constant.

### Concepts Used
- Orthodox Canonical Form
- Constructors and destructors
- Copy constructor
- Copy assignment operator
- Encapsulation

### Files
```bash
include/Fixed.hpp
src/Fixed.cpp
main.cpp
```

### Logic
`Fixed` class also provides:
- `getRawBits()` to read the internal raw integer
- `setRawBits()` to modify it manually

The important part of the implementation is how copying works:
- the copy constructor prints a message, then delegates to the assignment operator with `*this = other`;
- the assignment operator copies the internal value using `other.getRawBits()` and protects against self-assignment with `if (this != &other)`

### Example Input
```c++
Fixed a;
Fixed b(a);
Fixed c;
c = b;
```

### Example Output
```bash
Default constructor called
Copy constructor called
Copy assignment operator called
Default constructor called
Copy assignment operator called
getRawBits member function called
0
getRawBits member function called
0
getRawBits member function called
0
Destructor called

```

## ex01 — Towards a More Useful Fixed-Point Class

This exercise improves the `Fixed` class by allowing conversion between:
- integers
- floating-point numbers
- fixed-point representation

Two constructors are added to convert int and float values into fixed-point format.

### Concepts Used
- Fixed-point arithmetic
- Type conversion
- toFloat() and toInt() methods
- Operator overloading (<<)

### Files
```bash
include/Fixed.hpp
src/Fixed.cpp
main.cpp
```

### Logic
`Fixed`class adds:
- `Fixed(const int intNumber)`
- `Fixed(const float floatNumber)`
- `toFloat()`
- `toInt()`
- `overloaded operator<<` for easy printing

Integer constructor shifts left by the number of fractional bits
```c++
fixedPointNumber = intNumber << fractionalBitsNumber;
```
That means the integer is stored in fixed-point format.

Float constructor scales the value and rounds it:
```c++
float scaledValue = floatNumber * (1 << fractionalBitsNumber);
fixedPointNumber = roundf(scaledValue);
```

So a float like 42.42f is converted into a fixed-point integer representation.

Then:
- `toFloat()` divides by 1 << fractionalBitsNumber
- `toInt()` shifts right by fractionalBitsNumber
Overloaded << uses `toFloat()`, which is why printing a Fixed object displays the decimal value naturally.

### Example Input
```bash
Fixed a;
Fixed const b(10);
Fixed const c(42.42f);
Fixed const d(b);
a = Fixed(1234.4321f);
```

### Example Output
```bash
a is 1234.43
b is 10
c is 42.4219
d is 10

a is 1234 as integer
b is 10 as integer
c is 42 as integer
d is 10 as integer
```

## ex02 — Now We're Talking

This exercise expands the `Fixed` class by adding:
- comparison operators
- arithmetic operators
- increment/decrement operators
- min() and max() utility functions

Arithmetic and comparison operators are added so that fixed-point numbers behave like normal numeric types.

### Concepts Used
- Operator overloading
- Arithmetic operations
- Increment / decrement operators
- Static member functions

### Files
```bash
include/Fixed.hpp
src/Fixed.cpp
main.cpp
```

## Example Input
```bash
Fixed a;
Fixed const b(Fixed(5.05f) * Fixed(2));

std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << ++a << std::endl;
std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << a++ << std::endl;
std::cout << a << std::endl;
std::cout << b << std::endl;
std::cout << Fixed::max(a, b) << std::endl;
```

### Example Output
```bash
0
0.00390625
0.00390625
0.00390625
0
10.1016
10.1016
```
